# The-Prediction-Game
A short numbers game!

This is a small project that I have created to practice using Ruby.

The game is a maths trick that predicts the total number you are left with after a number of actions.

The game is to be run on the command line.

Follow the instructions and have fun :) 

Note* You only need to type your name when prompted, after this you only need to use "Enter".
